                  AdvocateKhoj.com. Data submitted by other Users (both lawyers
                  and lay persons) is not verified or reviewed in any way before
                  it appears on the AdvocateKhoj.com Web site. The accuracy,

                  AdvocateKhoj.com makes every effort to verify that lawyers who
                  subscribe to the Service are licensed and in good standing
                  with the local BAR at the time of registration. However,
                  AdvocateKhoj.com is unable to track, verify, or monitor the

                  Users are urged to make their own independent investigation
                  and evaluation of any lawyer or law firm being considered. The
                  determination of the need for legal services and the choice of
                  a lawyer are extremely important decisions and should not be
                  based solely on claims of expertise, or on the cost of
                  rendering the requested legal services.

                  limitation of practice by a lawyer or law firm. Please be
                  aware that no agency or board may have certified such lawyer
                  as a specialist or expert in any indicated field of law
                  practice. In addition, a lawyer claiming specialization is not
                  necessarily any more expert or competent than other lawyers.
                  It is up to the User to question the lawyers on the factual
                  basis of any statement they make, ask for the names of the
                  certifying agencies, and verify all information.

                  AdvocateKhoj.com strongly encourages lawyers to comply with
                  all regulations governing lawyer conduct, it is impossible for

                  A great danger for AdvocateKhoj.com, and for all operators of

                  wrongful actions of our Users. If one User libels another
                  User, the injured User might blame us, even though the first
                  User was really at fault. If a User uploads a program with a
                  computer virus, and the other Users' computers are damaged, we
                  might be blamed even though a User left the virus on our
                  System. If a User transmits illegal or improper information to
                  another User, we might be blamed even though we did nothing
                  more than unknowingly carry the message from one User to
                  another. Accordingly, we need all Users to accept
                  responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act
                  by another User that damages them must not be blamed on us,
                  but only on the other User.
